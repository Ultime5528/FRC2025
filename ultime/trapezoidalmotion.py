    Proof
    -----
    Let
    ds = displacement (s - s0)
    v = current speed (m/s)
    vi = initial speed (m/s)
    vf = final speed (m/s)
    a = acceleration (m/s²)
    as = "acceleration" by distance (change of speed per unit of distance traveled) (m/s / m)

    Hence, by definition:
    (1.1) as = (vf - vi) / ds (constant)
    (1.2) => ds = (vf - vi) / as

    Cinematic equations:
    (2.1) v = vi + a * t
    (2.2) => t = (v - vi) / a
    # (2.3) => a = (v - vi) / t

    With cinematic equation:
    (3) ds = vi * t + ½ * a * t²

    Replace t by (2.2) in (3)
    => ds = vi * (v - vi) / a + ½ * ((v - vi)/a)²
    => ds = (v² - vi²) / 2a
    => 2 a ds = v² - vi²
    (4) => v = sqrt( vi² + 2 a ds )

    In cases where we know as, but not a.
    We want to express v in respect of ds: v(ds) = ?

    We know that v(0) = vi. This is already the case: v(0) = sqrt( vi² + 2 a * 0 ) = vi.
    By eq. (1.2), we also know that the ds to reach vf is (vf - vi) / as.

    Hence,
    v((vf - vi) / as) = vf.

    Let's replace ds by (vf - vi) / as in eq. (4) and solve for a:
    vf = sqrt( vi² + 2 a (vf - vi) / as )
    vf² = vi² + 2 a (vf - vi) / as
    a = (vf² - vi²) / 2 ((vf - vi)/as)

    Hence,
    (5) v = sqrt( vi² + ds / ((vf - vi)/as) * (vf² - vi²) )

    The previous equation is more intuitive, but it can be simplified:
    (6) v = sqrt( vi² + as ds (vi + vf) )
